## About Me
I'm currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at NED University, with a strong passion for creating clean, responsive, and engaging web experiences. I specialize in frontend development and love turning ideas into user-friendly interfaces. Right now, I'm working on several real-world projects and JavaScript-based games to sharpen my skills. Alongside frontend work, I'm diving into Full Stack development with technologies like React, Node.js, and MongoDB. I'm always open to collaborative opportunities‚Äîespecially those that allow me to grow as a developer while contributing meaningfully to innovative projects or internships.
